# FAQ Test

## Get the app running

You'll need to install the Ruby language and Rails (a Ruby Gem).  There's plenty of guides and StackOverflow questions to help you.

Once you've got the Rails server running locally, http://localhost:3000 should give you the app landing page.

Once you've done that, run `bundle exec rake db:seed` to create the example data.  This data is based on real Gleam queries.

## The task

Your task is to read through the queries, build up a knowledge base of common questions/answers, then present that to users attempting to contact us.  The idea is that the knowledge base answers their questions so we don't have to :-) 

Maximum of 8 hours paid at 20 USD/hr.

## Hints
* Unsure if something is in/out of scope for the test?  Ask us.
* If you get stuck for more than 30 minutes, please ask for help in the Slack room.  We've got people around the world so it's likely you'll get a timely response.
* If you want to test the app, create a Gleam account and let us know what email it's under.  We'll give you a paid plan for testing.
