  "Hi, \n I use WIX as my web host and use their email sign-up widget on my website. I don't think you support it so I wanted to know what the best way to collect emails would then be for my contest? \n Also, I want to make sure that if I don't have an email system attached to my contest campaign that I can still export all the emails collected after it's over - yes? \n Thank you.",
  "I have a question about the accountability of required actions. If I link a website or FB page, do contestants gain points simply by clicking the widget or will they actually be brought to the website or FB page before they get the points? \n \n If it's not the latter, then all people really need to do is click the widget and they get points without even seeing the website/FB page, which is pretty useless. \n \n I'm not finding this answer on your website or while making my competition, so I was wondering if you could help me. Thanks.",
